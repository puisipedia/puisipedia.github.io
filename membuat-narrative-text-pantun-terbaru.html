                        True Friends<br /><br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures.

One of his workmen noted his frequent visits to the spot and determined to watch his movements. He soon uncovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold hidden by a miser, and stole it. On his next visit, the Miser, found nothing inside the hole and started to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, looking at him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, “Pray, do not grieve so; but go and put a stone in the hole, and imagine that the gold is still lying there. It will do to you quite the same act; for once the gold was there, you left it nothing, as you did not make the slightest use of it.”<br />

                        Saya ada 2 pilihan.<br />pilihan 1 : <br />“The Forbidden Chamber”<br /><br />Contoh narrative text pendek yang terakhir ini datang dari benua Amerika, tepatnya Mexico. Dan cerita rakyat satu ini paling panjang di antara dongeng lainnya. Tapi sepanjang-panjangnya tetep nggak lebih dari 500 kata koq. Dari teks naratif bahasa Inggris ini, kamu akan belajar tentang kebijaksanaan.<br /><br />Diceritakan seorang penyihir laki-laki yang jahat suka mencuri para gadis cantik. Ia menyamar sebagai pengemis dan mengetuk pintu untuk meminta sedekah. Nah, ia mengetuk pintu seorang pria yang tinggal bersama 3 puterinya yang cantik jelita. Si puteri sulung membuka pintu dan serta merta dihipnotis lalu diculik. Ia dibawa ke rumah penyihir di tengah hutan. Ia mendapatkan segalanya di rumah tersebut.<br /><br />Nah, suatu hari si penyihir akan melakukan perjalanan, ya mungkin sejenis traveling gitu deh. Sebelum pergi, ia memberikan kunci semua kamar dan sebuah telur yang harus dijaga. Penyihir itu memberi ijin kepada si puteri sulung untuk masuk ke semua ruangan kecuali satu ruangan tertentu, Jika ia melanggar, ia akan meninggal.<br /><br />Itu yang disebut The Forbidden Chamber alias ruang terlarang. Apa ya kira-kira yang ada dalam ruangan itu? Jika kamu jadi si puteri sulung, apa yang kamu lakukan?<br /><br />Story: <br />Once there was an evil wizard who dressed as a beggar. He went from house to house asking for alms and stealing the pretty girls. One day he knocked on the door of a house. There lived a man with three beautiful daughters. The eldest daughter opened the door and the wizard hypnotized her. He took her to his house in the midst of the woods. Everything was magnificent there. The daughter had all things she wished for.<br /><br />One day, the wizard had to go on a journey. He left the keys of all rooms to the daughter. She could enter every room except one, otherwise she could die. He also gave an egg she needed to care.<br /><br />After the wizard left the house, the daughter looked into every room and found beautiful things. Then she was curious to know about the forbidden room. She entered the room and found hundreds of kidnapped girls who had fallen asleep. The daughter frightened and ran out of the room. In a hurry, she dropped the egg and the egg turned red. The wizard came back and knew what had happened. Then, he dragged her into the forbidden chamber.<br /><br />Next day, he went back to the same house and stole the second sister. But the same thing happened to her. He went back a third time and kidnapped the youngest sister, but this girl was very wise.<br /><br />Before entering the forbidden chamber, she put the egg in the cupboard. Having known that there were many girls in the room including her sisters, she had an idea to release them. The wizard thought that the third daughter did what he said. He decided to marry her.<br /><br />Before getting married, the daughter asked the wizard to send a full basket of gold to her parents. In the bottom of the basket, there were her sisters covered with gold. While the wizard left the house, the daughter let all girls free. She also asked the girls and their parents to come to the wizard’s house.<br /><br />When the wizard came back, the girls and their parents dragged him into the forbidden chamber, locked the door and set fire to the house.<br /><br />pilihan 2 : <br /> “Momotaro Peach Boy”Momotaro The Peach <br /><br />Story<br />A long time ago, there lived an old and poor couple in a village in Japan. They didn’t wish for gold or fine clothes. They only wished for a child.<br /><br />One day, the old woman washed the clothes in the river. While washing, she was also wishing for a child. Then, a giant peach came floating down the river. She took it home and would cut it.<br /><br />There was a human voice from the peach saying not to cut the peach. Suddenly the peach split open and a baby boy jumped out of the peach. The old people were very happy and named him Momotaro which means Peach Boy.<br /><br />Time went by and people in the village were afraid of oni monsters who stole their belongings. When Momotaro was about 15 years old, he wanted to save his village from oni monsters. The old people were very proud of Momotaro. The old man gave him a sword and the old woman gave him a bag of dumplings.<br /><br />On the way, Momotaro met a dog, a monkey and a hawk. He shared the dumplings to them. The animals joined him to fight oni monsters. Being a good leader, Momotaro encouraged them to work together.<br /><br />Finally, Momotaro sucessfully forced the oni leader to surrender. Then Momotaro and his friends took the treasure and share it to all people in the village. The old man and woman were very happy that Momotaro came back safely.<br /><br />semoga membantu. jadikan yang terbaik ya !<br /><br />

                        We often hear about solar cars, solar 
heating, and solar batteries. But will solar energy ever be a major 
source of energy for society? Solar energy is cheaper than other fossil 
fuels because we can get an abundant source from the sun. In sunny 
desert areas, 50% of the sun's radiation that reaches the ground could 
be used to produce electricity for business and industry and to provide 
heat, light, and hot water for homes. Experimental solar ponds can also 
produce hot water to drive generators. 

<br />

Unfortunately, we can't yet power our homes entirely on sunlight. Solar 
energy can be used effectively in bright light. Its greatest potential 
therefor is in hot country that have clear skies for most of the year. 
But, unfortunately most houses are not in the sunniest part of the 
world. Moreover, in order to harness power solar cells are very cheap to
 run, but relatively expensive to buy and many people can't afford 
them. 

<br />

Needless to say, solar energy is useful and non-pollution source of 
energy. Unfortunately, solar cells, the main device to harness the sun's
 energy are still very expensive.

                        The Ugly Duckling<br /><br />A long time ago on an old farm, lived a duck family. One day, Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of a new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched and six beautiful yellow duckling popped out. But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it did not hatch. Mother Duck was suprised. How did it get there? ‘Tock! Tock!’ The duckling in that egg was pecking inside his shell.<br /><br />‘Did I count the eggs wrongly?’ Mother Duck wondered. Before the Mother Duck had time to think about it, the last egg hatched. A strange looking duckling with grey feathers worried Mother Duck. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck has a secret worry.<br /><br />‘I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine?’ she said to herself, shaking her head. Well, the grey dukling certainly was not pretty. He ate far more than his brothers, so that he was outgrowing the other ducklings. By the time passed by, the poor ugly duckling felt more and more unhappy. His brothers did not want to play with him. He was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals laughed at him because he is ugly. He felt sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to cheer up him.<br /><br />Then one day, the ugly duckling ran away from the farmyard. He began to question all the other birds. ‘Do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine?’ But everyone shook their heads in scorn.<br /><br />‘We don’t know anyone as ugly as you,’ they said.<br /><br />The ugly duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept on asking everyone he met. Then one day, his travels took him near an old countrywoman’s cottage. The old woman caught the ugly duckling because she was thinking he was a stray goose.<br /><br />‘I’ll put this in a hutch. I hope it’s female and lays plenty of eggs!’ said the old woman, whose eyesight was poor. The ugly duckling, however, did not lay a single egg. Then hen kept frightening him. She said that the woman would cook him if he could not lay egg. The duckling was frightened.<br /><br />Then one night, the ugly duckling found the hutch door ajar, so he escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as far away as he could, and at dawn, he found himself in a thick bed of reeds. One day at sunrise, he saw some beautiful birds flew above him. They were white, with long slender necks, yellow beaks and large wings. They were flying south to find food and new nests.<br /><br />‘If only I could look like them, just for a day!’ said the duckling, admiringly. Finally winter came. The weather became cold and the water was frozen. The poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow. He was exhausted and dropped to the ground. Luckily, a farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket. The farmer and his children look after him well.<br /><br />However, by springtime, he had grown so big that the farmer decided. ‘I’ll set him free by the pond!’ That was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in the water.<br /><br />‘Goodness! How I have changed! I hardly recognize myself!’ He was surprised because he became a beautiful duckling.<br /><br />The flight of swans flew north again and glided on to the pond. The duckling realized he was one of their kind when he saw them, and soon made friends.<br /><br />‘We’re swans like you!’ they said, warmly. ‘Where have you been hiding?’<br /><br />‘It’s a long story,’ the young swan replied, still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on the river bank exclaim: ‘Look at that young swan! He is the finestof them all!’<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />1.How was the duckling like when he came out of the last egg?<br />2.Did the duckling’s brother behave well towards him?<br />3.Why did the ugly duckling leave from the farmyard?<br />4.Who caught the duckling after he had left the farmyard?<br />5.What did the hen do when the duckling couldn’t lay egg?<br />6.Who took care of the duckling well?<br />7.Who was actually the young swan?<br />8.Can you mention the characters in the story?<br /><br /><br />Kunci Jawaban:<br /><br />1.He had grey feathers. He was ugly.<br />2.No, he did not. He did not want to play with the ugly duckling.<br />3.Because he was unhappy that his brothers did not want to play with him, he was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals simply laughed at him so he felt sad and lonely.<br />4.The old woman<br />5.The hen was frightening the ugly duckling that if he did not lay egg the old woman would cook him.<br />6.The farmer and his children took care of the duckling well.<br />7.The young swan was the ugly duckling.<br />8.The ugly duckling, Mother Duck, the od woman, the hen, the farmer and his children, the swans.<br /><br />sry klo kepanjangan :v<br />

                        <p>The Legend Of Banyuwangi</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there 
was a local ruler named King Sulahkromo. The king had a Prime Minister 
named Raden Sidopekso. The Prime Minister had a wife named Sri Tanjung. 
She was so beautiful that the king wanted her to be his wife.</p>
<p>One day, the King sent his
 Prime Minister to a long mission. While the Prime Minister was away, 
the King tried to get Sri Tanjung. However he failed. He was very angry.
 Thus, when Sidopekso went back, the King told him that his wife was 
unfaithful to him. The Prime Minister was very angry with his wife. Sri 
Tanjung said that it was not true. However, Sidopekso said that he would
 kill her. He brought her to the river bank. Before he kill her and 
threw her into the river, she said that her innocence would be proven 
After Sidopekso killed her, he threw her dead body into the dirty river.</p>
<p>The river immediately 
became clean and began to spread a wonderful fragrance. Sidopekso said, 
“Banyu…Wangi… Banyuwangi”. This means “fragrant water”. Banyuwangi was 
born from the proof of noble and sacred love.<br /></p><br /><p>Semoga bermanfaat salam persahabatan</p><p><br /></p><br /><br />

And then we went to the campus for joining lecture. But , the lecture said that our presentation would be started next week. It made us disappointed. The class was finished at 12.30. <br /><br />After that, I had to go home because my grandmother was in a bad condition. She was hospitalized. So, it was a must for me to back home at that time. When i got there, there were so many members of my family. There were about 10 people. My aunt, my niece, my uncle and some of my cousins. We all hoped that our grandmother would be better soon.<br /><br />Those activities made my day busy.<br />

                        The Golden Eggs<br /><br />Long time ago, a remote village, in central China, was inhabited mainly with farmers and hunters. One day, a poor farmer lost his entire livestock to flood. He prayed hard to God for help or his family would die of starvation.<br /><br />            Few days later, an old man with long grey beard, passed by his house took pity on him. He gave him a goose and said “I don’t have any expensive thing to give you and hope this goose will you to ease your hardship.”<br /><br />            A week later to his utmost surprise the farmer found an egg in his yard. This was not ordinary egg. It was a golden egg. He was suddenly overcome with joy.<br /><br />            Thereafter, the livelihood had rapidly improved but the farmer had forgotten his earlier hardship. He became lazy, arrogant, and spendthrift.<br /><br />            Strangely, the goose only laid one golden egg every six month. The greedy farmer lost his patient and slaughtered his goose thinking there were plenty of golden eggs inside its stomach. But, he didn’t get anything there.<br /><br />            Though he very much regretted for his foolishness, it’s already too late.<br /><br /><br />

This romantic guy folded 1,000 pieces of papercranes as a gift to his girl. Although, at that time he was just a small executive in his company, his future doesn’t seem too bright, they were very happy together. Until one day, his girl told him she was going to Paris and will never come back. She also told him that she cannot visualize any future for the both of them, so let’s go their own ways there and then… heartbroken, the guy agreed.<br />When he regained his confidence, he worked hard day and night, just to make something out of himself. Finally with all these hard work and with the help of friends, this guy had set up his own company… “You never fail until you stop trying.” he always told himself. “I must make it in life!” One rainy day, while this guy was driving, he saw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella in the rain walking to some destination. Even with the umbrella, they were still drenched. It didn’t take him long to realize those were his ex-girlfriend’s parents. With a heart in getting back at them, he drove slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot him in his luxury saloon. He wanted them to know that he wasn’t the same anymore, he had his own company, car, condo, etc. He had made it in life!<br />Before the guy can realize, the couple was walking towards a cemetery, and he got out of his car and followed them…and he saw his exgirlfriend, a photograph of her smiling sweetly as ever at him from her tombstone… and he saw his precious papercranes in a bottle placed beside her tomb. Her parents saw him.He walked over and asked them why this had happened. They explained that she did not leave for France at all. She was stricken ill with cancer. In her heart, she had believed that he will make it someday, but she did not want her illness to be his obstacle … therefore she had chosen to leave him.<br />She had wanted her parents to put his papercranes beside her, because, if the day comes when fate brings him to her again he can take some of those back with him. The guy just wept.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>berikut ini adalah cerita naratif tentang legenda Malin Kundang dalam bahasa Inggris:</p><p></p><p>Long time ago, in a coastal village of West Sumatra, Indonesia, lived a young and strong boy named Malin Kundang. He came from a poor family, but he was determined to make a better life for himself and his mother. He would go out to sea every day to catch fish, hoping to bring back enough to sell and support his family.</p><p></p><p>One day, while he was fishing far out at sea, a storm suddenly appeared. The waves grew enormous, and his small boat was tossed around like a leaf. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't control the boat, and it crashed against the rocks. Malin Kundang was thrown onto the shore, battered and bruised.</p><p></p><p>As he lay on the beach, a group of villagers found him. Among them was a woman who looked familiar – his own mother. She had been searching for him since the storm had hit. But instead of showing concern for her son's well-being, Malin Kundang denied knowing her. He was now wealthy and successful, and he was ashamed of his poor mother.</p><p></p><p>The heartbroken mother cried and begged her son to recognize her. She pleaded with him to return to his senses and show some compassion. But Malin Kundang was unyielding. He turned his back on his mother and walked away, leaving her weeping on the shore.</p><p></p><p>As Malin Kundang continued on his path of wealth and prosperity, he grew even richer. He became a successful trader with a grand mansion and a lavish lifestyle. But his success was accompanied by arrogance and cruelty. He became known for his heartlessness and lack of compassion.</p><p></p><p>Years later, when Malin Kundang was sailing near the same village, his ship was caught in a tempest. The waves roared, and the ship was on the brink of destruction. In his desperation, Malin Kundang finally remembered his mother and how he had abandoned her.</p><p></p><p>As he cried out for help, the storm's fury reached its peak. A thunderbolt struck his ship, and it crumbled into pieces. Malin Kundang was transformed into a stone, forever to be stranded on the shores of his homeland as a punishment for his heartlessness and betrayal.</p><p></p><p>And so, the legend of Malin Kundang serves as a reminder that wealth and success mean nothing if they are gained at the cost of compassion and respect for others. The story has been passed down through generations, a cautionary tale of the consequences of arrogance and the importance of remaining true to one's values.</p><br />

                        Elsa, Princess of Arendelle, possesses cryokinetic powers, with which she is able to produce or manipulate ice, frost and snow at will. One night while playing, she accidentally injures her younger sister, Anna. Their shocked parents, the king and queen, seek help from the troll king, who heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. The royal couple isolate the sisters in the castle until Elsa learns to control her magical powers. Afraid of hurting Anna again, and with her ability to control her powers deteriorating, Elsa spends most of her time alone in her room, refusing even to speak to Anna and a rift develops between the sisters as they grow up. When the girls are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.<br /><br />When Elsa comes of age, the kingdom prepares for her coronation. Among the guests is the Duke of Weselton, who seeks to exploit Arendelle for profit. Excited to be allowed out of the castle again, Princess Anna explores the town and meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles; the two quickly develop a mutual attraction. Despite Elsa's fears, her coronation takes place without incident. During the reception, Hans proposes to Anna, who hastily accepts. However, Elsa refuses to grant her blessing and forbids their sudden marriage. The sisters argue, culminating in the exposure of Elsa's abilities in an emotional outburst.<br /><br />Panicking, Elsa flees the castle, while inadvertently unleashing an eternal winter on the kingdom. High in the nearby mountains, she abandons her restraint, vowing to never return and building herself a solitary ice palace. Meanwhile, Anna leaves Hans in charge of Arendelle and sets out in search of her sister, determined to return her to Arendelle, end the winter and mend their relationship. While obtaining supplies, Anna meets an iceman named Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, and convinces Kristoff to guide her up the North Mountain. On their journey, the group encounters Olaf, Anna and Elsa's childhood snowman whom the latter recreated and unknowingly brought to life, who leads them to Elsa's hideaway.<br /><br />Anna and Elsa reunite, but Elsa still fears hurting her sister. When Anna insists that Elsa return, she becomes agitated and her powers lash out, accidentally striking Anna in the heart. Horrified, Elsa forces Anna, Kristoff and Olaf to leave by creating a giant snow creature named Marshmallow that chases them away from her palace. As they flee, Kristoff notices Anna's hair turning white and deduces that something is very wrong. He seeks help from the trolls, his adoptive family, who explain that Anna's heart has been frozen by Elsa. Unless it can be thawed by an "act of true love", she will become frozen solid forever. Believing that only Hans can save her with a true love's kiss, Kristoff races back with her to Arendelle.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hans, who is leading a search for Anna, reaches Elsa's palace. In the ensuing battle against the duke's men, Elsa is knocked unconscious by a falling chandelier and imprisoned in Arendelle. There, Hans pleads with her to undo the winter, but Elsa confesses that she has no idea how. When Anna reunites with Hans and begs him to kiss her to break the curse, Hans refuses and reveals that his true intention in marrying her is to seize control of Arendelle's throne. Leaving Anna to die, he charges Elsa with treason for her younger sister's apparent death.<br /><br />Elsa escapes and heads out into the blizzard on the fjord. Olaf comes across Anna and reveals Kristoff is in love with her; they then escape onto the fjord to find him. Hans confronts Elsa, telling her Anna is dead because of her. In Elsa's despair, the storm suddenly ceases, giving Kristoff and Anna the chance to locate each other. Nevertheless, Anna, seeing that Hans is about to kill Elsa, throws herself between the two just as she freezes solid, blocking Hans' attack.<br /><br />As Elsa grieves for her sister, Anna begins to thaw, since her decision to sacrifice herself to save her sister constitutes an "act of true love". Realizing love is the key to controlling her powers, Elsa reforms by thawing the kingdom and helps Olaf survive in summer. Hans is deported to the Southern Isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of Arendelle, while Elsa cuts off trade with Weselton. The two sisters reconcile and Elsa promises never to shut the castle gates again.<br />
